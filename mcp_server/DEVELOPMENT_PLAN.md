# Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the MCP (Model-Centric Programming) Server.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Tools

**Objective:** Establish the project foundation and implement the essential tools for file system interaction and code execution.

1.  **Project Initialization:**
    *   [x] Create the `mcp_server` project directory.
    *   [x] Initialize a Python virtual environment.
    *   [x] Create a `requirements.txt` file with initial dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`).
    *   [x] Create the main application file `main.py`.

2.  **Core Tool Implementation:**
    *   [x] Implement a basic FastAPI server in `main.py`.
    *   [x] Create API endpoints for the following core tools:
        *   `list_directory`
        *   `read_file`
        *   `write_file`
        *   `replace`
        *   `run_shell_command`
        *   `search_file_content`
        *   `glob`

3.  **Documentation:**
    *   [x] Create `README.md` with a project overview.
    *   [x] Create `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`.
    *   [x] Create `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Phase 2: Advanced Agentic Tools

**Objective:** Implement the more complex tools for planning, orchestration, and collaborative coding.

1.  **Planning and Orchestration:**
    *   [ ] Implement the `planner` endpoint. This will involve making a call to a language model to generate a plan.
    *   [ ] Implement the `orchestrator` endpoint to execute plans.

2.  **Ensemble Coding:**
    *   [ ] Implement the `consensus` endpoint for swarm coding. This will manage the state of a multi-agent debate and synthesize the results.

3.  **Code Quality:**
    *   [ ] Implement the `codereview` endpoint.
    *   [ ] Implement the `debug` endpoint.

## Phase 3: Web Integration & Finalization

**Objective:** Add web search capabilities and finalize the project for release.

1.  **Web Search:**
    *   [ ] Implement the `google_web_search` endpoint.

2.  **Finalization:**
    *   [ ] Generate and refine the OpenAPI documentation.
    *   [ ] Add comprehensive usage examples to the `README.md`.
    *   [ ] Write unit and integration tests for the tools.
