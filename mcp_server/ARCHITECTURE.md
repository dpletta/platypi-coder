# MCP Server Architecture

## 1. Overview

The MCP (Model-Centric Programming) Server is a Python-based application that exposes a suite of powerful coding tools to AI models through a REST API. It is designed to be a backend for AI agents, enabling them to perform complex software development tasks.

## 2. Components

### 2.1. FastAPI Server

The core of the application is a FastAPI server. This provides a high-performance, asynchronous framework for building the API. It also automatically generates OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation for the API, making it easy for developers (and AI models) to understand and use.

### 2.2. Tool Endpoints

Each tool is exposed as an API endpoint. These endpoints are defined in the `main.py` file and are responsible for receiving requests, validating parameters, and calling the appropriate tool implementation.

### 2.3. Tool Implementations

The logic for each tool is implemented in Python. These implementations are designed to be modular and reusable. For example, the file system tools are thin wrappers around standard Python libraries, while the more advanced agentic tools may involve calls to other language models.

### 2.4. Ollama Connector (Conceptual)

Ollama models will interact with the MCP Server by making HTTP requests to the tool endpoints. The server is stateless from the perspective of the Ollama model, meaning each API call is independent. For more complex, multi-step operations (like those managed by the `orchestrator` or `consensus` tools), the state will be managed by the MCP server.

## 3. API Design

*   **Protocol:** The API is based on standard HTTP methods (POST for actions).
*   **Data Format:** All data is sent and received as JSON.
*   **Authentication:** (Future) API key-based authentication can be added to secure the server.
*   **Error Handling:** The API will return standard HTTP error codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors) with a JSON body containing details about the error.

## 4. Data Flow

Here is a simplified data flow for a single tool call:

```
+---------------+
| Ollama Model  |
+---------------+
       |
       | 1. HTTP Request (JSON)
       v
+---------------+
| FastAPI Server|
| (main.py)     |
+---------------+
       |
       | 2. Call Tool Implementation
       v
+---------------+
| Tool Logic    |
| (Python)      |
+---------------+
       |
       | 3. Return Result
       v
+---------------+
| FastAPI Server|
+---------------+
       |
       | 4. HTTP Response (JSON)
       v
+---------------+
| Ollama Model  |
+---------------+
```

## 5. Extensibility

Adding a new tool involves two main steps:

1.  **Implement the tool logic:** Write a Python function that encapsulates the tool's functionality.
2.  **Create a new endpoint:** Add a new FastAPI endpoint in `main.py` that calls the tool logic. The endpoint should handle request and response data.
