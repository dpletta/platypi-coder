# MCP Server

Welcome to the MCP (Model-Centric Programming) Server! This server provides a powerful suite of coding tools to AI models, enabling them to perform a wide range of software development tasks.

## Overview

The MCP Server is a FastAPI-based application that exposes a REST API for various coding tools. These tools are designed to be used by AI agents, such as those running on Ollama, to interact with a development environment, write and modify code, and even collaborate with other agents.

## Features

*   **Core Coding Tools:** A comprehensive set of tools for file system operations, code execution, and searching.
*   **Planning & Orchestration:** Tools to break down complex tasks into plans and execute them step-by-step.
*   **Ensemble Coding:** A `consensus` tool that allows multiple AI agents to collaborate on solving problems.
*   **Code Quality & Debugging:** Integrated tools for code review and debugging.
*   **Web Search:** The ability for agents to search the web for information.
